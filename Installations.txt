Install:
Download Node.js version 10.13 or later @ https://nodejs.org/en/

Verify node and npm installed correctly, open command prompt and enter:
- `node -v`
- `npm -v`
 
If not working on a Windows machine and get a `node is not recognized as a ...`: 
- Open the command prompt and type in:
`SET PATH=C:\Program Files\Nodejs;%PATH%`
 (Answer found @ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23412938/node-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-an-external-command-operable-program)

Once working in command prompt, now check if Node.js works in IDE: (may have to restart IDE)
- `node -v`
- `npm -v`

May need to download a `Remote WSL` extention in your IDE. It was automatic for me when clicked link @: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial.  If not look up how to install extentions on IDE.
