Google: Search Engine Optimization

Server-Side Rendering
 
Anything past google sign in 
-> recorded by google bots
-> Anything that requires authentication is done client side
-> Anything that doesn't require authentications is done server side

server pre-renders homepage, sends pre-render html
-> faster render times for anything that doesn't require authentication


Every page has own index.js file: react for each webpage


Slug used to create dynamic pages for individual users

makes routing and search engine optimization easy. 



useContext() -> props not industry standard
-> takes info, create context, global scope so no props passed
